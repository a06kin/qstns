### Problem definition
Create a tiny RESTful web service with the following business requirements:

- Application must expose REST API endpoints for the following functionality:
    - ask question
    - list all accepted questions
    - list all accepted questions by country code
- User should be able to ask question publicly by providing question text. 
- Service must perform question validation according to the following rules and reject question if:
    -  Question contains blacklisted words listed in a dictionary
    - **N** questions / second are asked from a single country (essentially we want to limit number of questions coming from a country in a given timeframe)
- Service must perform origin country resolution using [the following web service](http://www.telize.com) and store country code together with the question. Because networking is unreliable and services tend to fail, let's agree on default country code - "lv".


### Technical requirements
You have total control over framework and tools, as long as application is written in Java. Feel free to write tests in any JVM language.

### What gets evaluated

- Conformance to business requirements
- Code quality, including testability
- How easy it is to run and deploy the service (don't make us install Oracle database please ;)

**Good luck and have fun!**
